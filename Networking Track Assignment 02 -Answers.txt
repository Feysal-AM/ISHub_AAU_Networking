Section 1: Networking Cables and Connectors
1.Main differences between STP and UTP cables:


✓STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Has a foil or braided shield around the twisted pairs to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). More expensive and bulkier.


✓UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): No shielding, more susceptible to EMI. Cheaper, more flexible, and commonly used in home and office networks.


2.Advantages and disadvantages of STP cables:


Advantages:
Reduces EMI, making it suitable for noisy environments (e.g., industrial settings).
Better performance for high-speed networks over longer distances.


Disadvantages:
More expensive than UTP.
Bulkier and less flexible, harder to install in tight spaces.


3.Coaxial cable definition and two main uses:
Definition: A cable with a central conductor surrounded by a shield, separated by a dielectric insulator, used for high-frequency signals.
Uses:
✓Cable television (TV) signal transmission.
✓Broadband internet connections.


4.Function of a BNC connector and typical use:
Function: A BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) connector locks coaxial cables securely, ensuring reliable signal transmission.
Typical use: Used in video equipment, older Ethernet networks (10BASE2), and test equipment like oscilloscopes.


5.Differences between RJ45 and RJ11 connectors:


Number of pins:
RJ45: 8 pins.
RJ11: 6 pins (commonly uses 2 or 4).
Use in networking or telephony:
RJ45: Used for Ethernet networking (e.g., connecting computers to routers).
RJ11: Used for telephone lines (e.g., connecting phones to wall jacks).


6.Maximum data transmission capacity and range of UTP Category 5e and Category 6:


Category 5e:


Capacity: Up to 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet).


Range: Up to 100 meters.


Category 6:


Capacity: Up to 10 Gbps (for shorter distances, ~55 meters).


Range: Up to 100 meters for 1 Gbps, 55 meters for 10 Gbps.


7.Two main types of Fiber Optic cables:
✓Single-mode Fiber: Uses a single light path for long-distance, high-speed transmission (e.g., telecom backbones).
✓Multi-mode Fiber: Uses multiple light paths for shorter distances, higher bandwidth in LANs.
8.Difference between Single-mode and Multi-mode fiber:
✓Single-mode: Smaller core (8-10 microns), single light path, longer distances (up to 100 km), used for telecom and WANs.
✓Multi-mode: Larger core (50-62.5 microns), multiple light paths, shorter distances (up to 2 km), used for LANs and data centers.
9.Two advantages of fiber optic cables over copper cables:
✓Higher bandwidth and faster data transmission (up to 100 Gbps or more).
✓Immune to EMI, ensuring reliable performance in noisy environments.
10.Color coding for T568A and T568B standards:
✓T568A:
Pin 1: White/Green, Pin 2: Green, Pin 3: White/Orange, Pin 4: Blue, Pin 5: White/Blue, Pin 6: Orange, Pin 7: White/Brown, Pin 8: Brown.
✓T568B:
Pin 1: White/Orange, Pin 2: Orange, Pin 3: White/Green, Pin 4: Blue, Pin 5: White/Blue, Pin 6: Green, Pin 7: White/Brown, Pin 8: Brown.


11.Straight-through cable use and two examples:
Use: Connects dissimilar devices (e.g., computer to switch or router to switch).
Examples:
Connecting a PC to a switch in an office LAN.
Connecting a router to a hub in a home network.
12.Crossover cable use and one real-world use case:
Use: Connects similar devices (e.g., computer to computer or switch to switch).
Real-world use case: Connecting two PCs directly to share files without a switch.
13.Two tools for creating or testing Ethernet cables:
✓Crimping tool: Used to attach RJ45 connectors to twisted pair cables.
✓Cable tester: Verifies connectivity and detects wiring faults in Ethernet cables.
14.Fill in the blanks:
A straight-through cable connects a computer to a switch/router.
A crossover cable connects a computer to a computer or a switch to a switch.
15.Comparison of coaxial, twisted pair, and fiber optic cables:
Cables 
	Difference in terms of Cost
	Difference in terms of Speed
	Susceptibility to interference 
	Twisted pair
	Twisted Pair (UTP/STP): Low (UTP cheapest, STP slightly more).
Fiber Optic:  
	Up to 10 Gbps (Cat 6/6a).
	High for UTP, low for STP (due to shielding).
	Fiber Optic
	High, due to materials and installation complexity.
	Up to 100 Gbps or more.
	None, immune to EMI.
	Coaxial
	Moderate, more than UTP but less than fiber.
	Up to 1 Gbps (broadband).
	Moderate, shielded but less than STP.
	

Section 2: Communication Models


16.Communication model definition:
A framework that describes how data is transmitted between devices in a network, including sender, receiver, message, medium, and protocols.
17.Three basic types of data flow with examples:
✓Simplex: One-way communication (e.g., TV broadcast).
✓Half-Duplex: Two-way, one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
✓Full-Duplex: Two-way simultaneous (e.g., phone call).
18.Differences between Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex:
✓Simplex: Data flows one way only (e.g., radio broadcast).
✓Half-Duplex: Data flows both ways, but not simultaneously (e.g., push-to-talk apps).
✓Full-Duplex: Data flows both ways simultaneously (e.g., video calls).
19.Importance of a protocol in a communication model:
Protocols define rules for data transmission, ensuring devices understand each other, maintaining reliability, and enabling interoperability (e.g., TCP ensures reliable delivery).


Section 3: OSI Model (In Detail)


20.Basic elements of a communication system:
✓Sender: Initiates the message (e.g., a computer sending data).
✓Receiver: Receives the message (e.g., a server).
✓Message: Data being transmitted.
✓Medium: Physical or wireless path (e.g., Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi).
✓Protocol: Rules governing communication (e.g., TCP/IP).
21.Seven layers of the OSI model (Top to Bottom):
✓Application,✓ Presentation,✓ Session, ✓Transport, ✓Network,✓ Data Link, ✓Physical.
22.Match OSI layers with protocols:
a. Application: HTTP
b. Transport: TCP
c. Network: IP
d. Data Link: Ethernet
e. Physical: Fiber Optic Cable
23.Main function of the Transport Layer (Layer 4):
Ensures reliable end-to-end data transfer, including error checking, segmentation, and flow control.
Protocols Used in this layer are: ✓TCP (reliable), ✓UDP (fast, less reliable).
24.Layer for IP addressing and its role:
Layer: Network Layer (Layer 3).
Role: Assigns IP addresses for logical addressing, routes packets across networks, and handles packet fragmentation/reassembly.
25.Data Unit Names:
Layer 4 (Transport): Segment
Layer 3 (Network): Packet
Layer 2 (Data Link): Frame
Layer 1 (Physical): Bit
26.Differences between router, switch, and hub, with OSI layers:
✓Router: Connects networks, uses IP addresses (Network Layer, Layer 3).
✓Switch: Connects devices in a LAN, uses MAC addresses (Data Link Layer, Layer 2).
✓Hub: Broadcasts data to all devices, basic connectivity (Physical Layer, Layer 1).
27.What happens at each OSI layer when sending a file:
✓Application: File access via app (e.g., FTP).
✓Presentation: File formatted/encrypted (e.g., to PDF).
✓Session: Session established between computers.
✓Transport: File broken into segments, numbered (TCP).
✓Network: Segments get IP addresses, routed (IP).
✓Data Link: Packets framed with MAC addresses (Ethernet).
✓Physical: Frames sent as bits over cable/Wi-Fi.
28.Importance of the OSI model:
Standardizes network communication, aiding design, troubleshooting, and interoperability across different systems.
29.Real-life analogy for OSI model:
Like sending a package: Application (writing letter), Presentation (translating), Session (starting conversation), Transport (numbering pages), Network (choosing postal route), Data Link (addressing envelope), Physical (delivering by truck).
30.OSI vs. TCP/IP model:
✓Similarity: Both use layered architectures for network communication.
✓Difference: OSI has 7 layers (theoretical), TCP/IP has 4 layers (practical, combines Application/Presentation/Session).
