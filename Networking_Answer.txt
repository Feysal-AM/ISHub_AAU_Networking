Answer for Networking Assignment 
Name:Feysal Ambiya
1. What is networking in the context of computer systems?
Networking refers to the practice of connecting two or more computers or electronic devices together to share data, resources (like printers and files), and allow for communication.


2. Why is networking important in modern computing environments?
Networking is crucial in modern computing for several reasons:
A.Resource Sharing: It allows multiple users to share devices like printers, scanners, and storage, which reduces costs and improves efficiency.
B.Data and Information Sharing: It enables quick and easy access to data and information for users across different locations.
C.Communication: It facilitates various forms of communication, such as email, video conferencing, and instant messaging.
D.Centralized Administration: It allows for centralized management of software, security updates, and data backups.


3. Which of the following best describes computer networking?(Answer:B. Sharing of data and resources between computers)


4. Differentiate between a network and the internet.
1.A network is a collection of interconnected devices within a limited scope (e.g., a home, office, or school) that can communicate with each other and share resources. 
2.The internet is a massive, global "network of networks." It connects millions of private, public, academic, and business networks, allowing devices worldwide to communicate.


5. Is the internet a type of network or a collection of networks? Explain.
The internet is a collection of networks. It is an interconnected system of computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is not a single network but a vast infrastructure that connects countless individual networks together.


6. What are some common uses of the internet in networking? (Mention at least 3)
1. World Wide Web (WWW):Accessing websites for information, entertainment, and e-commerce.
2. Electronic Mail (Email):Sending and receiving messages and files.
3.Cloud Computing and Storage:Using remote servers for data storage, processing, and accessing software services.


7. Name and briefly describe any three network topologies.
1. Star Topology:All devices are connected to a central device, like a hub or a switch. If the central device fails, the entire network goes down.
2. Bus Topology: All devices share a single communication line or cable (the "bus"). Data sent by one device is received by all others, but only the intended recipient accepts and processes it.
3.  Mesh Topology:Every device is connected directly to every other device on the network. This creates multiple paths for data and offers high redundancy but is expensive and complex to set up.


8.In which topology does every device connect to a central hub or switch?(Answer:B.Star)


9. What are the advantages and disadvantages of mesh topology?
A.Advantages: It is highly reliable and robust because data has multiple paths to travel. The failure of one link does not affect the rest of the network.
B.Disadvantages: It is expensive and complex to install and maintain due to the large amount of cabling and connections required.


10. Define the following network types: LAN, MAN, and WAN.
1.LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small geographical area, such as a single building or a campus.
2.MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):A network that spans a larger area than a LAN, such as a city or a large campus.
3.WAN (Wide Area Network):A network that extends over a large geographical area, often connecting multiple cities, states, or even countries. The internet is the largest example of a WAN.


11. Which type of network is most commonly used in schools and small offices?Why?
LAN (Local Area Network)is most commonly used. This is because it is ideal for connecting devices within a limited physical area, providing high-speed connectivity for sharing local resources like files, printers, and a single internet connection efficiently and cost-effectively.


12. Which network type covers the largest geographical area?(Answer:D. WAN)


13. List and define the function of any four common networking devices.
1.Router:A device that connects different networks together and forwards data packets between them. It determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
2.Switch:A device that connects multiple devices within the same network (a LAN). It intelligently forwards data only to the specific device that is the intended recipient.
3.Hub: A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. Unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts any data it receives to all connected devices.
4.Modem:A device that converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals for transmission over a communication line (like a phone line or cable) and vice versa. It connects a LAN to the internet.


14. What is the difference between a switch and a hub?
1.Hub: is a non-intelligent device that receives data and broadcasts it to every port and every connected device.
2. Switch: is an intelligent device that can identify the intended recipient of the data and sends it only to the specific port connected to that device, which reduces network traffic and improves performance.


15. A router is used to connect different networks together.(Answer=True)
